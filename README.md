# Huffman-Coding-Implementation-in-C-
This project is a C++ implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm for text compression and decompression. It demonstrates the creation of an efficient prefix-free binary encoding based on character frequency, achieving significant data compression for textual input.
-Calculates character frequencies dynamically.
- Builds a Huffman tree using a priority queue.
- Generates prefix-free binary codes for characters.
- Compresses text into a binary format.
- Decompresses binary strings back into the original text.
